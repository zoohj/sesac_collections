    "\n",
    "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has brought forth exciting possibilities for human-computer interaction. However, harnessing the full potential of these powerful AI models requires a crucial skill: prompt engineering. This burgeoning field focuses on crafting effective prompts that unlock the capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to understand intent, follow instructions, and generate desired outputs. As we increasingly interact with AI in various applications, prompt engineering plays a vital role in ensuring accurate, relevant, and safe interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "What is prompt engineering?\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing and optimizing prompts to guide AI models, particularly LLMs, towards generating the desired responses. By carefully crafting prompts, you provide the model with context, instructions, and examples that help it understand your intent and respond in a meaningful way. Think of it as providing a roadmap for the AI, steering it towards the specific output you have in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To dive deeper into the world of prompt design and explore its applications, check out the Introduction to Prompt Design on Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to experiment with LLMs and prompt engineering firsthand? Try the  Vertex AI free trial and experience the power of this technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a prompt for AI?\n",
    "In the context of AI, a prompt is the input you provide to the model to elicit a specific response. This can take various forms, ranging from simple questions or keywords to complex instructions, code snippets, or even creative writing samples. The effectiveness of your prompt directly influences the quality and relevance of the AI's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you need for prompt engineering?\n",
    "Several key elements contribute to effective prompt engineering. Mastering these allows you to communicate effectively with AI models and unlock their full potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt format\n",
    "The structure and style of your prompt play a significant role in guiding the AI's response. Different models may respond better to specific formats, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of your prompt plays a significant role in how the AI interprets your request. Different models may respond better to specific formats, such as natural language questions, direct commands, or structured inputs with specific fields. Understanding the model's capabilities and preferred format is essential for crafting effective prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context and examples\n",
    "Providing context and relevant examples within your prompt helps the AI understand the desired task and generate more accurate and relevant outputs. For instance, if you're looking for a creative story, including a few sentences describing the desired tone or theme can significantly improve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning and adapting\n",
    "Fine-tuning the AI model on specific tasks or domains using tailored prompts can enhance its performance. Additionally, adapting prompts based on user feedback or model outputs can further improve the model's responses over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "Designing prompts for multi-turn conversations allows users to engage in continuous and context-aware interactions with the AI model, enhancing the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of prompts\n",
    "There are various types of prompts used in AI, each serving a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct prompts (Zero-shot)\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting involves providing the model with a direct instruction or question without any additional context or examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is idea generation, where the model is prompted to generate creative ideas or brainstorming solutions. Another example is summarization, or translation, where the model is asked to summarize or translate some piece of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-, few- and multi-shot prompts\n",
    "This method involves providing the model with one or more examples of the desired input-output pairs before presenting the actual prompt. This can help the model better understand the task and generate more accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought Prompts\n",
    "CoT prompting encourages the model to break down complex reasoning into a series of intermediate steps, leading to a more comprehensive and well-structured final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot CoT Prompts\n",
    "Combines chain of thought prompting with zero-shot prompting by asking the model to perform reasoning steps, which may often produce better output.\n",
